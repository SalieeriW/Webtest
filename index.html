			<div> 
			As I said, I will be testing diferent tags of HTML in this page.
			Things that I want to do:
			<ul>
				<li>Watch anime</li>
				<li>Watch more anime</li>
				<li>Sleep</li>
				<li>Wake up</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div>Now that I've said that, lets try out some special chars:
				<ol>
					<li>This is the first char "&lt;" </li>
					<li>This is the second char "&gt;"</li>
					<li>This is the third char "&amp;"</li>
					<li>This is the last char "&copy;"</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>
				Once a wise man said that is you want to keep words from separating you have to use non-breakable spaces, aka nbsp, this allows you to keep the text from separating when resizing the browser.
			</p>
			<div>
				The following text is a example:
			</div>
			<p>
				This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. This&nbsp;is&nbsp;nbsp. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It's also important other tags like the nav, header, footer, aside. Where:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Header stands for the header (xd), its just top part of a page, usually where we put the logos and the nav tags.
						<div>
							<br> Example:
							<header>
								I am a header, even thought I'm not situated at the top of the site.
							</header>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Footer stands for footer, the lowest part of a page, where we usually put the copyright and bla bla bla...
						<div>
							<br> Example:
							<footer>
								I shouldn't be here, but anyways: All rights belongs to &copy;Nobody.
							</footer>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						The nav stand for navigated, as we can guess, it the top part of a page thats lets us navigate to diferent parts of a website.
						<div>
							<br>Example:
							<nav>
								<a href="https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F029%2F043%2FShaq_Tries_to_Not_Make_a_Face_While_Eating_Spicy_Wings___Hot_Ones_11-21_screenshot.jpg" target="_blank">
								I'm captain Sparrow, click me to navigate. </a>
							</nav>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						The last thing is aside, just some facts that is not very related to the topic that we are talking.
						<div>
							<br>Example:
							<aside>
								I like watching anime and eat popcorns while I'm having a shower.
							</aside>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				The last thing that I want to talk about is inserting video, images and hyperlinks. We can insert them using their tags.
				<ul>
					<li>
						The there's 3 types of hyperlinks: internal, external, and complete-external. The internal one is like the table of contents, complete-external is the Shaq that you may have seen before, and the normal external is the one let us jump into another part of the site, in another page, here's a example:
						<div>
							<br> <a href="external_page.html"> click me </a>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						For images there not much to say, just try to initialize the width and height of it.
						<div>
							<hr>
							<br> Example: <br>
							<img src="https://laverdadnoticias.com/__export/1669617887840/sites/laverdad/img/2022/11/28/la_waifu_de_la_temporada_estx_en_el_nuevo_anime_de_bocchi_the_rockx.jpg_2125252991.jpg" alt="An url type example: Bocchi the Rock" title="An url type example: Bocchi the Rock" width="560" height="315">
							<br>
							<img src="src/waifu.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="An url type example: Bocchi the Rock" title="An url type example: Bocchi the Rock">
							<aside> <br> Src can be local or a url</aside>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Same with videos:
						<div>
							<hr>
							<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfr64zoBTAQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
							</iframe>
							<aside>Chubaited by url</aside>
						</div>
						<div>
							<br><video width="560" height="315" controls>
								<source src="src/717902304.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								You browser just saved you from a double rick-roll.
							</video>
							<aside>Chubaited by local</aside>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
